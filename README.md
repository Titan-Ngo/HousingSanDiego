4. [ONLY FOR REPRODUCIBILITY - DO NOT RUN] Create Django Project. This command will create a backend folder with pre-built utility files and functions.
```
django-admin startproject backend
```
5. [ONLY FOR REPRODUCIBILITY - DO NOT RUN] Create Frontend folder. This will create a frontend folder with requisite scripts and functions. I have already created so running this code is not required.
